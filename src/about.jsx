                        VEEP is a unique program at the University of Toronto, pairing teams of four students with local not-for-profit organizations to work on innovative technical projects. For the upcoming year, we have twelve new and exciting projects from our non-profit partners. Some of these projects will run for the entire academic year, while some will conclude before the end of first semester. VEEP will also offer winter semester projects — check back later to apply!
                        Each student will contribute roughly four hours per week to their project, but this may not be distributed evenly through the term. Not-for-profit partners will contribute approximately an hour per week to the project.

                                Being in VEEP was a fantastic experience. It offered me an opportunity to work in a multi-year and multidisciplinary team to apply my academic knowledge for solving real problems for real industry clients. I would 10/10 recommend to any engineering student.
